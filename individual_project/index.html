                <h2>Feedback from Former Customers</h2>
                <p>Hello Cailey, Megan and the Heaps Estrin Team:</p>

                <p>I wanted to thank the Heaps Estrin Team for their professionalism and first rate service.</p>
                    
                <p>From start to finish I found Cailey and Megan listened, understood and were able guide us through the process to determine the best strategy to sell our home in an interesting market. They offered excellent advice, were respectful of our requests and continued to understand how to manage the prepping process. When we had questions they were quick to respond and managed to make an emotional time less stressful. From staging to sold, the experience was very positive, seamless and pleasant. Cailey, I would highly recommend Heaps Estrin, especially to those who are thinking of selling a home.</p>
                    
                <p>Thank you again for your tireless energy, professionalism and selling our home so quickly,</p>
                    
                <p>You and your team are AWESOME!</p>
